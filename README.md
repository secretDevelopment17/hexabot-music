<h2>Setup Tutorial</h2>

- First you can invite Hexa by [clicking here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=742740692773896225&permissions=8&scope=bot)
  > If you use the link above, the permission from Hexa is automatically set
- Then you can create a Text Channel, you can name whatever you want. For this tutorial I named it "music-player"
  > ![Text Channel Create](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778575261704781844/840833583244640286/unknown.png?width=194&height=281) 
- You can go to any channel and then run this command below. You can set a channel using a channel tag or channel id
  > ``h!setup [#music-player]`` or if using the channel id ``h!setup [channel ID]``
  > 
  > ![Send command setup](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778575261704781844/840836157125689354/unknown.png?width=312&height=52)
  > ![Send command setup](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778575261704781844/840837172587790346/unknown.png?width=312&height=52)
- And if it's successful, the result will be like this
  > ![Result](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778575261704781844/840839258575077416/unknown.png?width=431&height=473)
- And congratulations, your setup has been successful. Finally, you just have to enter the voice channel then you can write the song title or song url on the channel that was setup earlier
  > And here are the results when you play a song

  > ![Result](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778575261704781844/840840002199355422/unknown.png?width=435&height=473)

<h2>Setup Delete Tutorial</h2>
<p>Now is a tutorial on how to delete the channel setup</p>

- You can go to any channel and then run this command below
  > ``h!setup [#music-player] --delete`` or if using channel ID ``h!setup [channel ID] --delete``
  > 
  > ![Setup Delete](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/778575261704781844/840843305671458826/unknown.png?width=302&height=56)

- After that, the channel that used to be a setup channel is no longer a setup channel

<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

- Channel setup is only intended to play songs and is not allowed to chat on that channel
- You are not allowed to send any attachments to the channel setup
- You also have to comply with your server rules if your server has its own rules when it comes to playing music and user comfort
- It is forbidden to play music that contains NSFW elements, unless you set the channel setup as an NSFW channel
- Remember, this provision is only temporary and can be changed at any time. Conditions can also be made by the staff of each server
